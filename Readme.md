**"The first rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club."**

Fight Club brings Tyler Durden's underground vision to life. A brutal 3D combat experience built with React Three Fiber, featuring intelligent oponent, realistic combat mechanics, and an immersive basement environment.

**Key Features:**
- **Brutal Combat**: Punches, kicks, combos with stamina management
- **Smart Oponent**: Adaptive opponent that learns your fighting style
- **Underground Environment**: Basement bar with bloodstained floors and crowd
- **Progressive Combat**: Health, blocking, and victory tracking systems

No-holds-barred fighting here every punch matters and only the strongest survive.

*Warning: Mature themes and intense violence.*
